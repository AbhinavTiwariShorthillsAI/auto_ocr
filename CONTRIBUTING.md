- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**
- **Describe the current behavior and explain the behavior you expected to see**
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful**

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

- Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code
- Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved

## Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ocr-labeling-tool.git
   cd ocr-labeling-tool
   ```

3. **Set up the backend**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up the frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

5. **Run the tests**:
   ```bash
   python test_backend.py
   ```

6. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature
   ```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Update the README.md** with details of changes to the interface, if applicable
2. **Update the requirements.txt** if you add new Python dependencies
3. **Update the frontend/package.json** if you add new Node.js dependencies
4. **Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed** before the end of the layer when doing a build
5. **Test your changes** thoroughly:
   - Run the backend tests: `python test_backend.py`
   - Test the frontend manually
   - Test the OCR functionality with sample images
6. **Update documentation** as needed
7. **Submit your pull request**

## Style Guidelines

### Python Code Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings for functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and small
- Use type hints where appropriate

Example:
```python
def extract_text_from_image(image_path: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Extract text from an image using OCR.
    
    Args:
        image_path (str): Path to the image file
        
    Returns:
        Dict[str, Any]: Dictionary containing extracted text and metadata
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### JavaScript/React Code Style

- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Use JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Follow React best practices
- Use modern ES6+ features

Example:
```javascript
/**
 * Component for displaying OCR results
 * @param {Object} props - Component props
 * @param {string} props.text - Extracted text
 * @param {Function} props.onSave - Save callback
 */
const OCRResult = ({ text, onSave }) => {
  // Implementation here
};
```

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Good commit messages:
```
Add retry OCR functionality

- Implement retry button in UI
- Add backend endpoint for re-processing images
- Include error handling for failed retries
- Fixes #123
```
